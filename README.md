# DriveApiDemoApp
This repository shows how to manipulate files and folders by using Drive Android API. 

With Drive Android API, we can store the data like a local file storage, even when we are offline, thanks to an engine that runs in the background. When connection is back, it merges any change on the server.

This project was based in a two-parts article about Drive API. For implementation details, please, check this [article](http://androidahead.com/2018/07/04/driveapidemoapp-part-1/). The first part covers the following topics:
